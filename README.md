# cloud-agnostic-container-mgmt

A project to help you run container workloads the cloud-agnostic style.

For demonstrating we run a single page website on an nginx web server container. 

## What's the point? 

Isn't hard to achieve agnosticy to a satisfying extent. Well, yes. You are right in a way that is something that we have to balance. I mean there was an original reason why we decided to leave out data center strategy where we a responsible for ourselves about things like hardware management. Etc. and we don't plane to go back to that as we hope to get an advantage from it. Similar to a car manufacturer that does not raise his cows to get the leather for the car seats\

So you should decide between this two extreme poles: Fully usage of custom services and data center
